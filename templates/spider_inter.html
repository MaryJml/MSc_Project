Each book's timeline has multiple nodes representing different owners. Each node is labelled with the start year and owner ID, and the timelines of all the books converge at a red centre point, indicating that the books were once owned by the same owner (ID 3467). Different nodes of the same owner are connected by coloured lines, making it easy to trace the common history between different books. Hover to see more details such as book ID and owner ID.">
